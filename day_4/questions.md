## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

A method is set of expressions that returns a value.

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
```
def hello
  p "Sam I am"
end

```

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
```
def hello_someone(name)
  "#{name} I am"
end

```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
```
hello_someone("Joffrey")

```

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?

I don't have any specific questions that i haven't already addressed with my mentor.
